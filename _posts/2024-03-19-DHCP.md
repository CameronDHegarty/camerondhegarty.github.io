Note: Updates will continue to be made to this as I learn more about this topic and how it interacts with others. Additionally, if any mistakes are found, please email me and I will correct. Any corrections would be welcome!


## DHCP Communication

Successful DHCP is completed in four steps (DORA):

* DHCP DISCOVER - Starts communication with any DHCP servers
    * Sent as broadcast from the client
* DHCP Offer - DHCP servers response offering an IP address to the client
    * Sent as unicast from the server to the client
* DHCP Request - Clients response to the server confirming they're going to use the IP
    * Sent as broadcast from the client to the server
* DHCP Ack - DHCP Server's acknowledgement of the client's reply (finalizes the exchange)
    * Sent as unicast from the server to the client


There are also a few other messages that can be exchanged:

* DHCP Decline - Sent from the client to the server to inform them that IP address is already in use
    * Sent in place of the DHCP Request
* DHCP NAck - Sent from the server to indicate that the DHCP Request message is invalid for some reason
* DHCP Release - Sent from the client to the server to release a leased IP address
* DHCP Inform - Sent from the client to the server to request additional network config information when a new ip is not needed.

There are quite a few more, but these appear to be the main ones

## DHCP Options

* DHCP options are added to DHCP messages to convey certain types of information, which is specific to each option

Below are the options I felt would be valuable to remember (Will add more as I find them)

* Option 6 - DNS Server
* Option 15 - Domain Name
* Option 42 - NTP Server
* Option 150 - TFTP Server IP


## DHCP Server Configuration

* Can create DHCP reservation for specific clients by setting up a seperate pool and entering the client's identifier and the host IP/mask. 

== Will come back and add reservation example config ==

```
! Enable the DHCP server service on the router 
R6(config)#service dhcp

! Configure DHCP Server
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.15     ! Excludes IPs from being handed out from the pool
ip dhcp pool PAYROLL-DHCP
 network 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0          ! Define's DHCP pool network
 dns-server 8.8.8.8
 domain-name cisco.com
 default-router 10.0.0.1
 lease 0 9 24                  ! DHCP lease set to 0 days, 9 hours, and 24 minutes

```


## DHCP Relay Configuration

* When the DHCP server is not located on the local network segment, a dhcp relay is needed. A relay will receive the broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message and send it as unicast to the DHCP server

```
! For IPv4, DHCP relay is configured under the interface of the local network with the IP address of the DHCP server.
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip helper-address 150.1.1.1

```
