## uRPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding)

* Used to prevent malicious (spoofed) traffic from being routed on the network.
* Works by comparing the source address of the packet to the routing table. If it does not meet what's expected, uRPF will drop the packet. 

### Strict Mode

**Note:** If there is asymetric routing in the network, packets may be dropped when they should be forwarded.

* When in strict mode, the router will compare the source IP address of the packet to the route to that network in the routing table. If the packet is received on the interface which is used as the egress towards the sources network, then the packet will be forwarded. If not, uRPF will drop the packet. 
* Unless specified, the default route does not count.


**Configuration:**

```
R2(config-if)#ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx
```

### Loose Mode

* When in loose mode, the router will compare the source IP address of the packet to the route to that network in the routing table. If there is a route in the routing table to the sources network, the packet is forwared. If not, uRPF will drop the packet.
* Unless specified, the default route does not count.

**Configuration:**

```
R2(config-if)#ip verify unicast source reachable-via any
```

### Allow-default

* By default, default routes cannot be used as a match for uRPF in strict or loose mode. However, the allow-default option allows the default route to be used for this purpose
