## SSH

 SSH is primarily used for secure device access via the VTY lines on switches or routers. 

 SSH is a secure protocol that uses TCP port 22

Two versions:

* SSH Version 1.0-1.5
    * Version 1 is not considered secure, as it has some major security flaws
* SSH Version 2
    * Secure and the recommended version


**Note:** SSH version 1.99 is not a real SSH version. When it's displayed as the version on a Cisco device, it means that both SSH version 1 and version 2 are enabled. The "ip ssh version 2" command can be run under global config mode to force only version 2 to be used.



## Configuration

```
! Must configure RSA key on router before SSH can be used. 
! ip domain-name must be specified before RSA keys can be generated

R6(config)#ip domain-name cisco.com
R6(config)#crypto key generate rsa
The name for the keys will be: R6.cisco.com
Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 4096 for your
  General Purpose Keys. Choosing a key modulus greater than 512 may take
  a few minutes.

How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024
% Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...
[OK] (elapsed time was 0 seconds)

R6(config)#
*Mar 19 21:02:15.649: %SSH-5-ENABLED: SSH 1.99 has been enabled

R6(config)#ip ssh version 2
```
