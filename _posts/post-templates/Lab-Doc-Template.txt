**Note:** One of the things that I noticed on my first attempt of the ENARSI exam was that I was very poor at going into new topologies, evaluating them, and quickly making the required configurations. To help myself with this, I'm creating multiple different topologies, but also multiple labs with the same topologies that have different IP addressing. Due to this, the image of the lab topology does not contain any addressing information.

## Topology



## Tasks
* To start, please setup the topology as seen in the image above and copy the configuration to each device

## Configuration:

### R1 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R1
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R2 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R2
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R3 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R3
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R4 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R4
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R5 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R5
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R6 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R6
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R7 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R7
line con 0
logging sync
```

### R8 Configuration

```
conf t
hostname R8
