Note: Updates will continue to be made to this as I learn more about this topic and how it interacts with others. Additionally, if any mistakes are found, please email me and I will correct. Any corrections would be welcome!


## Use

BFD is used to provide sub-second failure detection between two adjacent routers. It can be used by a variety of protocols including (but not limited to) OSPF, BGP, EIGRP, RIP, IS-IS, and more. 

Benefits of using BFD:
* Extremely fast failure detection
* Low impact on the CPU compared to decreasing hello/dead intervals in routing protocols directly

## Operation & Features

BFD has two operating modes; asynchronous & demand:

**Asynchronous Mode:** This is the main mode used by BFD. In this mode both routers will send control packets to the other system. Once the defined number of packets has been missed, BFD will declare the neighbor as down.

**Demand Mode:** In this mode, once a BFD session is established the one of the routers may request that the other stop sending control packets. This is with the assumption that the router has an alternative way of verifying if the link has failed. One of the routers may request control packets from it's neighbor if it needs to verify completely that the link is up.

**Echo Feature:** The echo feature is a method where the router will send a number of BFD echo packets to its neighbor in a way that they are looped back to the originating router. If these BFD echo packets do not arrive back at the originating router, the link will be declared dead.
* Provides the best way of testing the forwarding path and will result in reduced round-trip jitter.
* Can be used in either asynchronous or demand mode.
* It can be enabled individually in each direction.


## Configuration

**NOTE:** BFD must be activated and actively being used by another protocol for the neighborships to form.


**BFD Interface Configration**
```
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.1.4.4 255.255.255.0
 bfd interval 50 min_rx 50 multiplier 3
 bfd echo
 ! This command enables bfd on the interface with a send interval of 50 ms, it expects BFD hellos from its neighbor every 50 seconds, and the multiplier 3 means that if it has not received any hellos from its neighbor in min_rx * multiplier (50 ms * 3) it will consider the neighbor to be dead.
```

**BFD Template Configuration**
```
bfd-template single-hop BFD-TEMPLATE
 interval min-tx 50 min-rx 50 multiplier 3
 echo

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 bfd template BFD-TEMPLATE
```

**OSPF Configuration**
```
! Can be enabled (or disabled "ip ospf bfd disable") per interface:
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip ospf bfd
 
! OR Can be enabled for all interfaces under the ospf router configuration:
router ospf 1
bfd all-interfaces
```

**EIGRP Configuration**
```
! Configured under the af-interface configuration when using named mode
router eigrp A
 address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 1
  !
  af-interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   bfd
  exit-af-interface

! Or configured under the eigrp router configuration when using classic
! Can either be set for all interfaces
router eigrp 1
 bfd all-interfaces

! OR per interface
router eigrp 1
 bfd interface GigabitEthernet0/0
```

**BGP Configuration**
```
! Configured for a neighbor under the BGP router configuration
router bgp 65001
 bgp log-neighbor-changes
 neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 65001
 neighbor 10.0.0.1 fall-over bfd
```

## Authentication

* As far as I can tell BFD authentication is only available when using BFD-template configuration

```
! Configured with MD5 or SHA1 authentication methods
! Keys are configured using a keychain

! key chain configuration:
key chain KEYS
 key 1
  key-string CCNP

! Configuration with MD5:
bfd-template single-hop BFD-TEMPLATE
 interval min-tx 50 min-rx 50 multiplier 3
 authentication md5 keychain KEYS
 echo

! Configuration with SHA-1:
bfd-template single-hop BFD-TEMPLATE
 interval min-tx 50 min-rx 50 multiplier 3
 authentication sha-1 keychain KEYS
 echo
```
